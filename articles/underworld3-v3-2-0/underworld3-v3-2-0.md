## Four capabilities in more detail

Geometric multigrid will matter a lot to those running big Stokes problems. If you have been letting Underworld fall back to algebraic multigrid without thinking about it, [Setting Up Full Multigrid](/setting-up-full-multigrid/) explains what the difference is worth. 

Free-slip and traction conditions on curved boundaries are supported, which matters for modelling a lot of problems. Documentation is in [Boundary conditions on non-planar boundaries](/boundary-conditions-on-non-planar-boundaries/).

SUPG stabilisation is now the default for both advection-diffusion and Navier-Stokes, so most models pick it up without being asked. Against the semi-Lagrangian alternative it is cheaper per step and much more accurate with small Courant numbers. Above a Courant number of about 2 the semi-Lagrangian scheme is better. [Eulerian Navier-Stokes](https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld3/blob/v3.2.0/docs/advanced/eulerian-navier-stokes.md) and [Eulerian advection-diffusion](https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld3/blob/v3.2.0/docs/advanced/eulerian-advection-diffusion.md) document the trade.

The largest body of work this quarter went into faults. You can now specify a fault network once, as a trace and a hierarchy, and have it realised either as a split-node cut with contact laws or as a volumetric weak plane. Faults can now be modelled as real mesh discontinuities rather than smeared weak zones. [Faults: to mesh or not to mesh?](/putting-a-fault-in-a-mesh/) covers the choice and why it is not obvious.

The prognostic free surface is now dimension-general and runs in three dimensions on a spherical shell. [A free surface in Underworld](/free-surface-in-underworld/) describes the method.

## Things that will break

There are five breaking API changes. They are listed with migration guidance in the release notes.

## Getting it

```bash
git clone --branch v3.2.0 https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld3.git
```

Containers are at `ghcr.io/underworldcode/underworld3`, and if you would rather
not install anything at all, you can run a notebook in your browser — see
[Running Underworld in a Browser](/running-underworld-in-a-browser/).

The full [release notes](https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld3/releases/tag/v3.2.0) list every bug fix, improvement and breaking change, and the names of everyone who contributed.
